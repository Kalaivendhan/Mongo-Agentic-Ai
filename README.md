The engagement layer is more of a general purpose operational data layer which can be aligned for both types of use cases OLTP and OLAP. However, MongoDB is optimized more towards OLTP than OLAP.

Its the Document DB and it can do real time analytics.

MongoDB ensures high availability of data and services through its built-in replication, multi-cloud, and multi-region feature. More details - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/

Very broad question in evolving situation. To attempt a brief response, the data infra must enable AI workloads to naturally communicate with data infra, including facilitating scalability, factual semantic retrieval, and efficient memory management.

What's the costing of Mongo in comparison? E.g. We're finding plenty of cases of people deploying naive RAG (then smashing their client's budgets by stupidly Re-RAG'ing again and again) - E.g. If you setup RAG correctly, you'd MCP it in on an Agentic basis
Setup the Agent - boom- done.

You get these nut job architectures from our competitors stupidly RAG'ing entire databases... 

Thats where the trade-off between performance and optimization comes. Voyage embedding models are well placed in forefront of this particular area by innovating methods and algorithms.

love those russian doll setups.
